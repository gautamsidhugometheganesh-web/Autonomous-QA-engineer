+# Four-Week Delivery Plan for the Autonomous QA Engineer
+
+This roadmap assumes a small team and weekly deliverables that compound into an early usable product.
+
+## Week 1 – Discovery & Foundations
+- Confirm target environments (frameworks, auth flows, critical journeys) and capture a demo app for dogfooding.
+- Decide on browser automation stack (e.g., Playwright) and data format for captured user flows.
+- Ship a local workspace scaffold that can track flows, environments, and metadata.
+- Add basic CLI to initialize a workspace and record placeholder flows.
+- Draft success metrics (time to first auto-generated test, nightly pass rate, MTTD for regressions).
+
+## Week 2 – Flow Capture & Test Generation
+- Implement instrumentation to capture DOM events and convert them into portable steps.
+- Build a first-pass test synthesizer that converts captured flows into Playwright tests with resilient selectors.
+- Add deterministic fixture management (users, seeds) so replay is stable.
+- Provide a nightly scheduler entrypoint and local dry-run capability.
+- Start persisting run artifacts (logs, screenshots) to disk.
+
+## Week 3 – Autonomous Runs & Issue Creation
+- Wire scheduled runs to execute the generated tests headlessly on the latest main branch.
+- Detect flakiness versus real failures using retry heuristics and signal weighting.
+- Automatically draft GitHub issues with repro steps, environment, failing selectors, and screenshots.
+- Add simple learning loop: prioritize failing/high-churn flows for regeneration.
+
+## Week 4 – Hardening & Adoption
+- Add configuration validation, secrets handling, and per-environment overrides.
+- Integrate with CI (GitHub Actions template) and produce a minimal dashboard/report summary.
+- Build growth hooks: Slack/Email notifications for failures and weekly health summaries.
+- Document operational runbooks and add guardrails for destructive actions (e.g., feature flags for write paths).
+
+## Success Criteria
+- First automated flow captured and replayed end-to-end by Week 2.
+- Nightly scheduled run with artifacts by Week 3.
+- Issue creation with screenshots plus repro steps by Week 3-4.
+- <5% flaky test rate on the demo app by the end of Week 4.
+
+## Near-Term Next Steps (starting today)
+- Land workspace scaffolding and CLI to manage flows and configuration.
+- Define data models for flows, steps, and test cases to keep the agent pluggable.
+- Provide a basic “plan run” action to show how nightly executions will be orchestrated.
